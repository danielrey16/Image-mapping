    Grips are an essential component of any bicycle. They provide a comfortable and secure way for cyclists to hold on to the handlebars while riding. The grips also help absorb vibrations from the road, providing a more comfortable riding experience. Grips are typically made from rubber, foam, or synthetic materials.
